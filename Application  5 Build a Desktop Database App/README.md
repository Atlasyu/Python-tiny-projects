# Application 5: Build a Desktop Database App

Create a database and a GUI to access the database. Convert it to a standalone app.

Methods: sqlite3, Tkinter, global varible, cx_Freeze, pyinstaller

1. Couldn't find a solution to convert the app.
2. CX_Freeze: ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found. Setup.py is for converting to an app.
3. Pyinstaller doesn't support python 3.6. Dannnnnn.
